This is one of the QAP (quadratic assignment problem) test problems of Nugent et al. 20 departments are to be placed in 20 locations with five in each row (see below). The objective is to minimize costs between the placed departments. The cost is (flow * rectilinear distance), where both flow and distance are symmetric between any given pair of departments. The flow and distance matrices are attached to this assignment. The optimal solution is 1285 (or 2570 if you double the flows).
(note: rectilinear is also known as Manhattan distance)
